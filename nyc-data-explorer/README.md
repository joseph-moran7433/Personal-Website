# NYC Data Explorer — data build

Precomputes everything the **NYC Data Explorer** page (Projects → NYC Data Explorer on the site) shows.

```
pip install requests
python build_explorer_data.py              # rebuild every tab
python build_explorer_data.py sales nta    # rebuild only some tabs
```

- Queries NYC Open Data and data.ny.gov directly via SoQL and lets the server do the counting. No API keys, nothing bulk-downloaded.
- Writes small JSON files to `../assets/nyc-explorer/`, which `assets/nyc-explorer/explorer.js` renders with D3.
- `pull_manifest.json` records every dataset ID, row count, coverage dates and pull timestamp.

Builders: `nta` (2020 NTA boundaries, simplified), `inspections` (DOHMH `43nn-pn8j`), `sales` (DOF `w2pb-icbu`),
`licenses` (NYS SLA `9s3h-dpkz` + `6dg3-2z7i`), `food_access` (`4kc9-zrs2`, `8vwk-6iz2`, `tc6u-8rnp`).

This is profiling only: coverage, fields, missingness, distributions and data-quality traps. No analysis.
To add a tab, write a `build_<name>()` here, register it in `BUILDERS`, and add a render function + entry in `TABS` in `explorer.js`.
